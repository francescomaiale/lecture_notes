By determining the compatibility conditions we establish theorems of existence and uniqueness of solutions to the modified Dirac equation, and the associated Laplace equation, such that they correspond to a scalar operator. We also discuss the problem using fixedpoint methods and analyze a physical realization were the solutions to the Laplace equation can be interpreted as a set of electric potentials coupled to each other. Our solutions could be relevant in the analysis of new exotic phases of nature, such as topological insulators were the Dirac nature of the charge carriers implies new physical properties which go beyond the standard description of conventional charge carriers in electronic systems by means of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation.},

The main applications given here are to Hamiltonian systems of ordinary differential equations where the existence of time periodic solutions is established for several classes of Hamiltonians.},

	Abstract = {The claim found in many textbooks that the Dirac equation cannot be written solely in terms of Pauli matrices is shown to not be completely true. It is only true as long as the term ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0143-0807/37/5/055407/ejpaa2c9bieqn1.gif] {$\beta \psi $} in the usual Dirac factorization of the Klein--Gordon equation is assumed to be the product of a square matrix β and a column matrix ψ . In this paper we show that there is another possibility besides this matrix product, in fact a possibility involving a matrix operation, and show that it leads to another possible expression for the Dirac equation. We show that, behind this other possible factorization is the formalism of the Clifford algebra of physical space. We exploit this fact, and discuss several different aspects of Dirac theory using this formalism. In particular, we show that there are four different possible sets of definitions for the parity, time reversal, and charge conjugation operations for the Dirac equation.},
